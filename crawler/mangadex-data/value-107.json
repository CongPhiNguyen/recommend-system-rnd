The only sweet reprieve he had was his weekends.\nHowever, one day, he got caught up in a fight between transcendents and died an unfortunate death.\n“I knew I’d end up dying from sticking my nose where it doesn’t belong.”\nRight as he was thinking so, he woke up. He had regressed to the year 2002.\nWith this, he thought that he’d finally get to live the life of action-series protagonists in webtoons.\nHowever, his dream was short-lived—he still didn’t have any powers. Instead, he possessed a curse that could cut his once-in-a-lifetime opportunity short.\nCan Kim MuJin save himself from his curse and make the most out of his regression?\n\n\n<Cursed Manager’s Regression> is a part of Grand Cross Universe Story.\n\n\n\n<죽음의 신, 하 변호사> Web Novel\n<신 우렁각시전> Web Novel\n<범이 내려왔다> Webtoon"},{"name":" The Art of Gardening","avatar":"https://mangadex.org/covers/5186684e-6877-4aa7-a864-cec8b2a33c61/e4d70b12-a37d-4163-9a81-331aceea88ca.jpg.256.jpg","country":"Chinese (Simplified)","stat":"7.81","status":"Completed","tags":["Oneshot,Comedy,Slice of Life,Supernatural"],"nutshell":"A boy discovers that his bonsai has a human form."},{"name":" Bang Dream! - TeethTeethGary's Bandori Single Image Compilation (Doujinshi)","avatar":"https://mangadex.org/covers/518c3a6c-1249-41e5-8e07-905806fd2677/046157e1-cb2b-4613-98a4-1aea5c2fed86.jpg.256.jpg","country":"Chinese (Traditional)","stat":"7.85","status":"Ongoing","tags":["Comedy,Girls' Love,School Life,Slice of Life"],"nutshell":"A collection of stand alone single images by TeethTeethGary located here: https://twitter.com/teethteethgary\nNote: The genres will vary depending on the image.\nCredits for A3's Band Scans: Translator, PR, QC - Miala, Cleaner/Re-Drawer, Typesetter, PR, QC - Lex, Pr, QC - Otto"}]
